# Enemies

In Last Odyssey, every character that is capable of fighting the player characters in combat is called an _<dfn id = "term-enemy">enemy</dfn>._  Not every NPC is an enemy, but any NPCs that also have a set of corresponding combat statistics and give the player characters XP when they die count.

Each enemy on the battlefield has combat statistics and a set of abilities, both active and passive.  Enemies can also take any of the basic set of actions outlined in the Combat Round subsection of the Combat Rules, with the exception of Summon Eidolon.  The GM is responsible for narrating and controlling enemy behavior during battle.  However, rather than simply treating a battle as a chess match between them and the players, GMs should instead play them like characters.  This is especially important because learning enemy abilities and behavior is an intended part of the experience of playing Last Odyssey.  Here are some principles the GM should stick to when narrating combat:

1.  _Provide context._  Combat in Last Odyssey is an abstract representation of a fight rather than a straightforward simulation.  All actions taken by participating characters should also be things that they do in the narrative.  For example, rather than stating that an enemy uses the Fire Burst ability, the GM should describe its appearance.
2.  _Hide enemy statistics._  The Scan ability and the mechanics around information assume that players will be ignorant of the current HP, MP, Shell, statistics, and abilities of an enemy unless they put effort into learning them, and thus the GM should not them until the right conditions are met.
3.  _Tell players what they've done, and what's been done to them._  GMs should tell them how much damage they are doing to enemies, what status effects have been inflicted on all characters, and how much damage they are taking.

Enemies differ from player characters in a few important ways.  First, enemies begin with a Shell of their elemental type in addition to their HP, and this Shell can be colorless if the enemy's elemental type is also colorless.  Enemies also count as their elemental type for the purpose of calculating the damage they receive.  Finally, each enemy has a creature type, which is a single word that describes what kind of being it is.  In the base game, there are ten creature types: 
* Human
* Construct
* Fairy
* Animal
* Demon
* Angel
* Elemental
* Undead
* Dragon
* Horror

An enemy's description in the Monster Manual will list their Tier, their creature type, their elemental type, and whether they are Normal, Elite, or an Antagonist for the purposes of XP calculation.  It will look like this: ((XP Type) (Tier), (Creature Type), (Elemental Type)).
